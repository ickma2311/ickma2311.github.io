### ∇ Deep Learning Book <span class="section-count">33 chapters</span>

My notes on the Deep Learning book by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville.

**[Chapter 9.5: Convolutional Functions](ML/convolutional-functions.qmd)**
Mathematical details of convolution operations: deep learning uses cross-correlation (not true convolution), multi-channel formula $Z_{l,x,y} = \sum_{i,j,k} V_{i,x+j-1,y+k-1} K_{l,i,j,k}$, stride for downsampling, three padding strategies (valid/same/full), and gradient computation.

**[Chapter 9.4: Convolution and Pooling as an Infinitely Strong Prior](ML/cnn-infinitely-strong-prior.qmd)**
Why CNNs work on images but not everywhere: architectural constraints (local connectivity + weight sharing) act as infinitely strong Bayesian priors, assigning probability 1 to translation-equivariant functions and 0 to all others.
:::

::: {.content-card}
**[Chapter 9.3: Pooling](ML/cnn-pooling.qmd)**
Downsampling through local aggregation: max pooling provides translation invariance by selecting strongest activations, reducing 28×28 feature maps to 14×14 (4× fewer activations).

### 📐 MIT 18.06SC Linear Algebra <span class="section-count">36 lectures</span>

My journey through MIT's Linear Algebra course, focusing on building intuition and making connections between fundamental concepts.

::: {.content-card}
**[Lecture 27: Positive Definite Matrices and Minima](Math/MIT18.06/mit1806-lecture27-positive-definite-minima.qmd)**
Connecting positive definite matrices to multivariable calculus and optimization: the Hessian matrix, second derivative tests, and the geometric interpretation of quadratic forms as ellipsoids.
:::

::: {.content-card}
**[Lecture 26: Complex Matrices and Fast Fourier Transform](Math/MIT18.06/mit1806-lecture26-complex-matrices-fft.qmd)**
Extending linear algebra to complex vectors: Hermitian matrices, unitary matrices, and the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm that reduces DFT complexity from O(N²) to O(N log N).
:::

::: {.content-card}
**[Lecture 28: Similar Matrices and Jordan Form](Math/MIT18.06/mit1806-lecture28-similar-matrices-jordan.qmd)**
When matrices share eigenvalues but differ in structure: similar matrices represent the same transformation in different bases, and Jordan form reveals the canonical structure when diagonalization fails.

My notes from MIT 18.065 Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing, and Machine Learning.

**[Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices](Math/MIT18.065/mit18065-lecture8-norms.qmd)**
Understanding vector p-norms ($\|v\|_p$) and when they satisfy the triangle inequality (only for $p \geq 1$). The "$\frac{1}{2}$-norm" creates non-convex unit balls for strong sparsity.
