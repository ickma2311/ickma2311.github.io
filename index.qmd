# Welcome to ickma.dev

My learning notes and thoughts on math and machine learning.

Currently reading the **Deep Learning book**.

## Deep Learning Book

### [Chapter 6.1: XOR Problem & ReLU Networks](ML/xor-deep-learning.ipynb)
How ReLU solves problems that linear models cannot handle.

### [Chapter 6.2: Likelihood-Based Loss Functions](ML/likelihood-loss-functions.ipynb)
The mathematical connection between probabilistic models and loss functions.

## Mathematics

### [MIT 18.06 Lecture 1: The Geometry of Linear Equations](Math/mit1806-lecture1-geometry.ipynb)
Two powerful perspectives that reveal the hidden beauty of linear systems: row picture vs column picture.
