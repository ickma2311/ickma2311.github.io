# Welcome to ickma.dev

My learning notes and thoughts on math and machine learning.

Currently reading the **Deep Learning book**.

## Deep Learning Book

### [Chapter 6.1: XOR Problem & ReLU Networks](ML/xor-deep-learning.ipynb)
How ReLU solves problems that linear models cannot handle.

### [Chapter 6.2: Likelihood-Based Loss Functions](ML/likelihood-loss-functions.ipynb)
The mathematical connection between probabilistic models and loss functions.

## More

### Machine Learning
- [K-Means Clustering](ML/kmeans.ipynb)
- [Logistic Regression](ML/logistic_regression.qmd)
- [Axis Operations](ML/axis.qmd)

### Algorithms
- [DP Regex](Algorithm/dp_regex.qmd)
