# Blog Quality Checklist

Use this as a focused checklist for error checking and readability improvements.

## Technical Accuracy
- Math correctness: signs, denominators, constraints, and edge conditions.
- Dimension checks: verify matrix/vector shapes and block equations.
- Derivation completeness: include key steps that the notes emphasize.
- Equation hygiene: LaTeX syntax, references, and consistent notation.

## Readability
- Transitions: add a short intro when sections begin abruptly.
- Conciseness: trim verbosity while preserving meaning.
- Intuition: add 1-2 clarifying sentences where the notes are too terse.
- Examples: keep at least one small concrete example if present in the notes.

## Media
- Images: place in the requested local folder and reference with correct relative paths.
