GRU simplifies this design by merging forget and input into a single update gate, reducing parameters while maintaining the ability to capture long-range dependencies through gating mechanisms.\n\n\nChapter 10.9: Leaky Units and Multiple Time Scales Leaky units separate instantaneous state from long-term integration using \\(u^t = \\alpha u^{t-1}+(1-\\alpha)v^t\\). Multiple time scale strategies include temporal skip connections (direct pathways across time steps) and removing short connections (forcing coarser time scales) to address long-term dependencies.\n\n\nChapter 10.8: Echo State Networks ESNs fix recurrent weights and train only output weights, viewing the network as a dynamical reservoir. Setting spectral radius near one enables long-term memory retention. Learning reduces to linear regression on hidden states, avoiding backpropagation through time—showing that carefully designed dynamics can capture temporal structure.\n\n\nChapter 10.7: The Challenge of Long-Term Dependencies The fundamental challenge of long-term dependencies in RNNs is training difficulty: gradients propagated across many time steps either vanish exponentially (common) or explode (rare but severe). Eigenvalue analysis shows how powers of the transition matrix govern this instability.\n\n\n\nSee all Deep Learning chapters →\n\n\n\n📐 MIT 18.06SC Linear Algebra 36 lectures\nMy journey through MIT’s Linear Algebra course, focusing on building intuition and making connections between fundamental concepts.\n\n\nLecture 27: Positive Definite Matrices and Minima Connecting positive definite matrices to multivariable calculus and optimization: the Hessian matrix, second derivative tests, and the geometric interpretation of quadratic forms as ellipsoids.\n\n\nLecture 26: Complex Matrices and Fast Fourier Transform Extending linear algebra to complex vectors: Hermitian matrices, unitary matrices, and the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm that reduces DFT complexity from O(N²) to O(N log N).\n\n\nLecture 28: Similar Matrices and Jordan Form When matrices share eigenvalues but differ in structure: similar matrices represent the same transformation in different bases, and Jordan form reveals the canonical structure when diagonalization fails.\n\n\nLecture 25: Symmetric Matrices and Positive Definiteness The beautiful structure of symmetric matrices: real eigenvalues, orthogonal eigenvectors, spectral decomposition, and the important concept of positive definiteness.\n\n\n\nSee all MIT 18.06SC lectures →\n\n\n\n📐 MIT 18.065: Linear Algebra Applications 2 lectures\nMy notes from MIT 18.065 Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing, and Machine Learning—exploring how linear algebra powers modern applications.\n\n\nLecture 9: Four Ways to Solve Least Squares Problems Four equivalent methods for solving \\(Ax = b\\) when \\(A\\) has no inverse: pseudo-inverse, normal equations, algebraic minimization, and geometric projection—all converging to the same optimal solution.\n\n\nLecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices Understanding vector p-norms (\\(\\|v\\|_p\\)) and when they satisfy the triangle inequality (only for \\(p \\geq 1\\)). The “\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)-norm” creates non-convex unit balls for strong sparsity.\n\n\n\nSee all MIT 18.065 lectures →\n\n\n\n📐 Stanford EE 364A: Convex Optimization 7 lectures\nMy notes from Stanford EE 364A: Convex Optimization—theory and applications of optimization problems.\n\n\nLecture 5.2: Monotonicity with Generalized Inequalities K-nondecreasing functions satisfy \\(x \\preceq_K y \\Rightarrow f(x)\\le f(y)\\). Gradient condition: \\(\\nabla f(x) \\succeq_{K^*} 0\\) (dual inequality). Matrix monotone examples: \\(\\mathrm{tr}(WX)\\), \\(\\mathrm{det}X\\). K-convexity extends convexity to generalized inequalities with dual characterization and composition theorems.\n\n\nLecture 5.1: Log-Concave and Log-Convex Functions Log-concave functions satisfy \\(f(\\theta x+(1-\\theta)y)\\ge f(x)^\\theta f(y)^{1-\\theta}\\). Powers \\(x^a\\) are log-concave for \\(a \\ge 0\\) and log-convex for \\(a \\le 0\\). Key properties: products preserve log-concavity, but sums do not. Integration of log-concave functions preserves log-concavity.\n\n\nLecture 4 Part 2: Conjugate and Quasiconvex Functions Conjugate functions \\(f^*(y) = \\sup_x (y^\\top x - f(x))\\) are always convex, with examples including negative logarithm and quadratic functions. Quasiconvex functions have convex sublevel sets with modified Jensen inequality \\(f(\\theta x + (1-\\theta)y) \\leq \\max\\{f(x), f(y)\\}\\). Examples include linear-fractional functions and distance ratios.\n\n\nLecture 4 Part 1: Operations preserving Convexity Pointwise maximum and supremum (support function, distance to farthest point, maximum eigenvalue), composition with scalar functions (exponential, reciprocal), vector composition (log-sum-exp), minimization over convex sets (Schur complement, distance to set), and perspective functions with examples.\n\n\n\nSee all EE 364A lectures →"
