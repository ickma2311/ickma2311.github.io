# Welcome to ickma.dev

My learning notes and thoughts on math and machine learning.

Currently reading the **Deep Learning book**.

## Deep Learning Book

### [Chapter 6.1: XOR Problem & ReLU Networks](ML/xor-deep-learning.qmd)
How ReLU solves problems that linear models cannot handle.

### [Chapter 6.2: Likelihood-Based Loss Functions](ML/likelihood-loss-functions.qmd)
The mathematical connection between probabilistic models and loss functions.

### [Chapter 6.3: Hidden Units and Activation Functions](ML/activation-functions.qmd)
Exploring activation functions and their impact on neural network learning.

### [Chapter 6.4: Architecture Design - Depth vs Width](ML/architecture-design.qmd)
How depth enables hierarchical feature reuse and exponential expressiveness with fewer parameters.

### [Chapter 6.5: Back-Propagation and Other Differentiation Algorithms](ML/backpropagation.qmd)
The algorithm that makes training deep networks computationally feasible through efficient gradient computation.

### [Chapter 7 Prerequisites: Hessian Matrix, Definiteness, and Curvature](ML/hessian-prerequisites.qmd)
Essential second-order calculus concepts needed before Chapter 7 on optimization algorithms.

### [Chapter 7.1.1: L2 Regularization (Parameter Norm Penalty)](ML/l2-regularization.qmd)
How L2 regularization shrinks weights based on Hessian eigenvalues, preserving important directions while penalizing less sensitive ones.

### [Chapter 7.1.2: L1 Regularization](ML/l1-regularization.qmd)
L1 regularization uses soft thresholding to push small weights to exactly zero, creating sparse solutions that perform feature selection.

### [Chapter 7.2: Constrained Optimization View of Regularization](ML/constrained-optimization-regularization.qmd)
Regularization as constrained optimization: penalty form vs Lagrangian with KKT conditions and min-max dual training.

### [Chapter 7.3: Regularization and Under-Constrained Problems](ML/regularization-underconstrained.qmd)
Why regularization is mathematically necessary when solving under-constrained linear systems, and how it ensures invertibility.

### [Chapter 7.4: Dataset Augmentation](ML/dataset-augmentation.qmd)
How transforming existing data can improve generalization and combat overfitting when training data is limited.

### [Chapter 7.5: Noise Robustness](ML/noise-robustness.qmd)
Mathematical derivation showing how adding Gaussian noise to weights is equivalent to penalizing large gradients.

## Mathematics

### Reflections & Synthesis
- [Deep Connections: Invertibility, Null Space, Independence, Rank, and Pivots](Math/reflections/mit1806-invertibility-connections.qmd)
  Exploring how these fundamental concepts are different perspectives on information preservation in linear transformations.

### MIT 18.06SC Linear Algebra
- [Lecture 1: The Geometry of Linear Equations](Math/MIT18.06/mit1806-lecture1-geometry.ipynb)  
  Two powerful perspectives that reveal the hidden beauty of linear systems: row picture vs column picture.
- [Lecture 2: Elimination with Matrices](Math/MIT18.06/mit1806-lecture2-elimination.qmd)  
  The systematic algorithm that transforms linear systems into upper triangular form for easy solution.
- [Lecture 3: Matrix Multiplication and Inverse](Math/MIT18.06/mit1806-lecture3-multiplication.qmd)  
  Five different perspectives on matrix multiplication, from element-wise computation to rank-1 decomposition, plus understanding when matrices can't be inverted.
- [Lecture 4: LU Decomposition](Math/MIT18.06/mit1806-lecture4-lu-decomposition.ipynb)  
  Factoring matrices into Lower × Upper triangular form: the foundation of efficient numerical linear algebra and solving multiple systems with the same matrix.
- [Lecture 5.1: Permutation Matrices](Math/MIT18.06/mit1806-lecture5-permutations.qmd)  
  Permutation matrices reorder rows and columns using a simple structure of 0s and 1s.
- [Lecture 5.2: Transpose](Math/MIT18.06/mit1806-lecture5-2-transpose.qmd)  
  The transpose operation switches rows to columns, creating symmetric matrices.
- [Lecture 5.3: Vector Spaces](Math/MIT18.06/mit1806-lecture5-3-spaces.qmd)  
  Vector spaces and subspaces: closed under addition and scalar multiplication.
- [Lecture 6: Column Space and Null Space](Math/MIT18.06/mit1806-lecture6-column-null-space.qmd)  
  Column space determines which $b$ make $Ax = b$ solvable. Null space contains all solutions to $Ax = 0$.
- [Lecture 7: Solving Ax=0 - Pivot Variables and Special Solutions](Math/MIT18.06/mit1806-lecture7-solving-ax-0.qmd)  
  Systematic algorithm to find null space using pivot/free variables and RREF. Dimension of null space is n-r.
- [Lecture 8: Solving Ax=b - Complete Solution to Linear Systems](Math/MIT18.06/mit1806-lecture8-solving-ax-b.qmd)  
  Complete solution is particular solution plus null space. Four cases based on rank: exactly determined (unique), overdetermined (0 or 1), underdetermined (infinite), and rank deficient (0 or infinite).
- [Lecture 9: Independence, Basis, and Dimension](Math/MIT18.06/mit1806-lecture9-independence-basis-dimension.qmd)
  Linear independence prevents redundancy, basis is minimal spanning set, dimension measures space size. Rank-nullity theorem: dim(C(A)) + dim(N(A)) = n.
- [Lecture 10: Four Fundamental Subspaces](Math/MIT18.06/mit1806-lecture10-four-subspaces.qmd)
  The four fundamental subspaces completely characterize any matrix: column space, null space, row space, and left null space.
- [Lecture 11: Matrix Spaces, Rank-1, and Graphs](Math/MIT18.06/mit1806-lecture11-matrix-spaces.qmd)
  Matrix spaces as vector spaces, rank-1 matrices, dimension formulas for subspace intersections and sums, and differential equations as vector spaces.
