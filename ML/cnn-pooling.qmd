## Overview

This section explains the pooling operation in convolutional neural networks:

- **Local translation invariance**: How pooling makes networks insensitive to exact spatial locations
- **Max pooling**: Downsampling by selecting maximum activations in neighborhoods
- **CNN architectures**: Comparing no pooling, max pooling, and global average pooling approaches

Pooling reduces spatial resolution while preserving important features, making CNNs more robust to translations.

## 1. Local Translation Invariance

**Local translation invariance means that small shifts in the input produce nearly unchanged outputs.** After convolution and pooling, the representation becomes insensitive to the exact spatial location of features, responding mainly to whether a feature is present rather than where it appears within a small neighborhood.

*Figure: How pooling creates translation invariance - different detectors respond strongly to different shifted versions of the same pattern, but the pooling unit aggregates these responses into a single large output. Thus, even when the input '5' appears at different positions, the pooled representation remains nearly unchanged.*

## 2. Max Pooling

**Pooling reduces the spatial resolution of feature maps by summarizing local neighborhoods** (e.g., via max or average). It makes the representation more robust to small translations, reduces sensitivity to exact pixel locations, and improves computational and statistical efficiency.

**"Max pooling downsamples the activations by summarizing each local neighborhood, so there are fewer pooling units than activation units."**

## 3. CNN Architecture Structures

### Left: No Pooling (Stride-Based Downsampling)

This architecture removes pooling entirely and relies on **strided convolutions** to reduce spatial resolution.

Each convolution layer computes features while simultaneously downsampling the image.

After a few strided convolutions, the feature maps are flattened and fed into a fully connected classifier.

**Key characteristic**: This design keeps the structure simple but usually requires more parameters in the classifier, since the flattened representation can be relatively large.

### Middle: Max Pooling Network

This is the **classic CNN architecture** where pooling layers follow convolution layers.

Max pooling discards precise spatial information while keeping the strongest local responses, reducing spatial resolution and achieving some translation invariance.

After several conv-pool stages, the final feature maps are flattened and passed through fully connected layers.

**Key characteristic**: This design is statistically efficient and was widely used in early CNNs, including LeNet and AlexNet.

### Right: Global Average Pooling (GAP) Network

Instead of flattening or using dense layers, this architecture uses a **final convolution with as many channels as there are classes**.

Each channel then becomes a class-specific activation map.

**Global average pooling** collapses each map into a single scalar, producing one score per class.

**Key advantage**: This removes the need for fully connected layers, greatly reducing parameters and improving robustness.

GAP-based designs are common in modern architectures such as Network-in-Network and many variants of ResNet.
