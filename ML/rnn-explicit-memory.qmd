Neural networks are good at storing implicit knowledge, but weak at remembering facts.

## Key Concepts

**Explicit memory** introduces a separate, addressable storage component outside the network parameters, allowing models to **read from and write to memory explicitly** rather than encoding all information in hidden states.

- A controller network (often an RNN) learns **how to access memory** via read/write mechanisms, using **content-based** and/or **location-based addressing**.

- This design alleviates the need to propagate information through long time spans, thereby **avoiding vanishing/exploding gradients** for long-term dependencies.

- Explicit memory is well suited for tasks requiring **precise storage, retrieval, and algorithmic behavior** (e.g., copying, sorting, question answering).

## Practical Considerations

However, classic explicit memory architectures (e.g., Memory Networks, Neural Turing Machines) are **computationally expensive, difficult to train, and rarely used in practice**.

Their primary contribution is **conceptual**: separating computation from storage and inspiring later, more practical mechanisms.

## Modern Realizations

Modern architectures such as **attention, Transformers, and retrieval-augmented models** can be viewed as **successful, scalable realizations of the explicit memory idea**.
