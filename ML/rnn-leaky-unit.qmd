To address the long-term dependency problem, models can be designed to operate on **multiple time scales**, allowing some components to process information at **fine temporal resolution**, while others operate at **coarser time scales** to effectively propagate information from the distant past.

# Leaky Unit

Leaky units introduce an explicit separation between instantaneous state computation and long-term state integration. By using a candidate state $v^{(t)}$ and a time constant $\alpha$, the model can operate on multiple time scales, alleviating long-term dependency issues without relying solely on recurrent weight dynamics.

$$
u^t \leftarrow \alpha u^{t-1}+(1-\alpha)v^t
$$

In a leaky RNN, the candidate state $v^{(t)}$ replaces the instantaneous hidden update, while the leaky state $\mu^{(t)}$ replaces the true hidden state. The relation between them is temporal integration, not a learned transformation.

# Temporal Skip Connection

**Temporal skip connections address long-term dependencies by introducing direct pathways across multiple time steps, allowing information and gradients to propagate over longer temporal distances without relying solely on step-by-step recurrence.**

# Removing Connection

**Removing connections addresses long-term dependencies by eliminating length-1 temporal connections, forcing information to propagate only through longer-range pathways and thereby biasing the model toward coarser time scales.**
