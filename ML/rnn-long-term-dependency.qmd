The fundamental challenge of long-term dependencies is not representational capacity but **the difficulty of training recurrent networks**.

During backpropagation through time, gradients must be propagated across many steps, causing:

- **vanishing gradients** (the common case), where the gradient shrinks exponentially and the network cannot learn dependencies across distant time steps
- **exploding gradients** (rare but severe), where the gradient grows exponentially and destabilizes learning

**The figure shows how repeatedly applying the same nonlinear function causes saturation or steep amplification. Although the x-axis is not time, these compositions mirror the effect of many RNN time steps, explaining why gradients vanish or explode during long-term dependency learning.**

## Mathematical Analysis

$$
h^{t} = W h^{t-1} \tag{10.36}
$$

Hidden state after $t$ steps can be written as the repeated application of the same linear transformation:

$$
h^{t} = W^{t} h^{0} \tag{10.37}
$$

showing that long-term behavior is governed by powers of the transition matrix.

$$
W = Q\Lambda Q^{\top} \tag{10.38}
$$

We can analyze its dynamics in the eigenbasis if $W$ is diagonalizable:

$$
h^{t} = Q \Lambda^{t} Q^{\top} h^{0} \tag{10.39}
$$

Each eigenvalue raised to the $t$-th power either shrinks (vanishing) or grows (exploding), explaining instability over long time horizons.
