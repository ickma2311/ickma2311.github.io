**[Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices](mit18065-lecture8-norms.qmd)**
Understanding vector p-norms ($\|v\|_p$) and when they satisfy the triangle inequality (only for $p \geq 1$). The "$\frac{1}{2}$-norm" creates non-convex unit balls for strong sparsity. S-norms $\sqrt{v^T S v}$ generalize to ellipses. Matrix norms: spectral $\|A\|_2 = \sigma_1$, Frobenius $\|A\|_F = \sqrt{\sum \sigma_i^2}$, nuclear $\|A\|_N = \sum \sigma_i$—all expressed via singular values.
