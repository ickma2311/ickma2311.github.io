**[Lecture 8: Norms of Vectors and Matrices](mit18065-lecture8-norms.qmd)**
Understanding vector p-norms ($\|v\|_p$) and when they satisfy the triangle inequality (only for $p \geq 1$). The "$\frac{1}{2}$-norm" creates non-convex unit balls for strong sparsity. S-norms $\sqrt{v^T S v}$ generalize to ellipses. Matrix norms: spectral $\|A\|_2 = \sigma_1$, Frobenius $\|A\|_F = \sqrt{\sum \sigma_i^2}$, nuclear $\|A\|_N = \sum \sigma_i$—all expressed via singular values.

**[Lecture 9: Four Ways to Solve Least Squares Problems](mit18065-lecture9-least-squares.qmd)**
Four equivalent methods for solving $Ax = b$ when $A$ has no inverse: pseudo-inverse $\hat{x} = A^+ b$ using SVD, normal equations $A^T A \hat{x} = A^T b$, algebraic minimization of $\|Ax - b\|_2^2$, and geometric projection of $b$ onto $C(A)$. All methods converge to the same solution when $A^T A$ is invertible: $\hat{x} = (A^T A)^{-1}A^T b$.
