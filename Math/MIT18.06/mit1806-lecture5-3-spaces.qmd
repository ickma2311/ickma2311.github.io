## Context

[My lecture notes](https://github.com/ickma2311/foundations/blob/main/MIT18.06SC/lecture05/5.3_space.md)

Vector spaces and subspaces are fundamental structures in linear algebra. This post covers the vector spaces portion of Lecture 5.

## Definition

The space $\mathbb{R}^n$ has exactly **n dimensions**.

**Example:**
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}
$$
is a matrix in $\mathbb{R}^{2 \times 2}$ (2×2 real matrices).

## Subspaces

A **subspace** is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ that is closed under addition and scalar multiplication.

### Examples of Subspaces

**In $\mathbb{R}^2$:**
- A line through the origin creates a subspace

**In $\mathbb{R}^3$:**
- A line through the origin creates a line subspace
- A plane through the origin creates a plane subspace

**In $\mathbb{R}^4$:**
- Think: How can we create subspaces in $\mathbb{R}^4$?

## Properties of Subspaces

A subspace must satisfy two properties:

### 1. Closed Under Addition

If vectors $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$ are in the subspace, then $\vec{v} + \vec{w}$ is also in the subspace.

**Example:** For $\mathbb{R}^2$ line $y=2x$:
- $[1,2]$ and $[2,4]$ are in the line
- $[1,2] + [2,4] = [3,6]$ is still in the line ✓

### 2. Closed Under Scalar Multiplication

If vector $\vec{v}$ is in the subspace and $c$ is any scalar, then $c\vec{v}$ is also in the subspace.

**Example:** For $\mathbb{R}^2$ line $y=2x$:
- $[1,2]$ is in the line
- $1.5 \times [1,2] = [1.5, 3]$ is still in the line ✓
