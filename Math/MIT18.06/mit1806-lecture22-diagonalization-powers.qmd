This lecture explores one of the most powerful applications of eigenvalues and eigenvectors: **diagonalization**. By expressing a matrix in terms of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we can efficiently compute matrix powers and solve recurrence relations like the Fibonacci sequence.

## Diagonalizing a Matrix

A matrix $A$ is diagonalizable if it can be written as:

$$
S^{-1}AS = \Lambda
$$

where $\Lambda$ is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of $A$.

**Key definition**: $S$ is the matrix whose columns are the $n$ eigenvectors of $A$:

$$
S = \begin{bmatrix}
| & | & | & | \\
x_1 & x_2 & \ldots & x_n \\
| & | & | & |
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Why Does Diagonalization Work?

When we compute $AS$, we multiply $A$ by each eigenvector column:

$$
AS = \begin{bmatrix}
| & | & | & | \\
\lambda_1 x_1 & \lambda_2 x_2 & \ldots & \lambda_n x_n \\
| & | & | & |
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Since $Ax_i = \lambda_i x_i$ for each eigenvector, multiplying by $A$ simply scales each column by its corresponding eigenvalue.

Now, multiplying both sides by $S^{-1}$ from the left:

$$
S^{-1}AS = \begin{bmatrix}
\lambda_1 & 0 & \ldots & 0 \\
0 & \lambda_2 & \ldots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \ldots & \lambda_n
\end{bmatrix} = \Lambda
$$

This gives us a beautiful representation of $A$:

$$
SS^{-1}AS = S\Lambda = IAS = AS
$$

$$
ASS^{-1} = S\Lambda S^{-1}
$$

$$
A = S\Lambda S^{-1}
$$

This formula expresses $A$ in terms of its eigenvalues ($\Lambda$) and eigenvectors ($S$).

## Powers of A

### A Squared

If $Ax = \lambda x$, then what happens when we apply $A$ again?

$$
A^2 x = A(Ax) = A(\lambda x) = \lambda Ax = \lambda^2 x
$$

**Conclusion**:

- The eigenvalues of $A^2$ are the squares of $A$'s eigenvalues
- The eigenvectors of $A^2$ are the same as $A$'s eigenvectors

Using diagonalization:

$$
A^2 = S\Lambda S^{-1} \cdot S\Lambda S^{-1} = S\Lambda^2 S^{-1}
$$

Notice how the middle terms $S^{-1}S$ cancel to give the identity matrix, leaving us with $\Lambda^2$.

### The General Power Formula

By the same reasoning:

$$
A^k = S\Lambda^k S^{-1}
$$

where $\Lambda^k$ is simply the diagonal matrix with each eigenvalue raised to the $k$-th power:

$$
\Lambda^k = \begin{bmatrix}
\lambda_1^k & 0 & \ldots & 0 \\
0 & \lambda_2^k & \ldots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \ldots & \lambda_n^k
\end{bmatrix}
$$

**Key properties**:

- The eigenvalues of $A^k$ are the $k$-th powers of the eigenvalues of $A$
- The eigenvectors remain unchanged

This formula transforms a difficult problem (computing matrix powers) into a simple one (raising numbers to powers).

### Important Theorems

**Theorem 1 (Convergence to zero)**: $A^k \to 0$ as $k \to \infty$ if and only if all $|\lambda_i| < 1$.

This is because $\lambda_i^k \to 0$ when $|\lambda_i| < 1$, making all entries in $\Lambda^k$ approach zero.

**Theorem 2 (Diagonalizability with distinct eigenvalues)**: If all eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ are distinct (no repeated eigenvalues), then $A$ is guaranteed to have $n$ independent eigenvectors and is diagonalizable.

**Theorem 3 (Repeated eigenvalues)**: If there are repeated eigenvalues, $A$ may or may not have $n$ independent eigenvectors.

**Examples**:

- The identity matrix $I_n$ has eigenvalue 1 repeated $n$ times, but it has $n$ independent eigenvectors (any vector is an eigenvector)
- Triangular matrices with repeated eigenvalues often lack sufficient eigenvectors

### Example: Non-diagonalizable Matrix

Consider:

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}2 & 1 \\ 0 & 2\end{bmatrix}
$$

Finding eigenvalues:

$$
|A - \lambda I| = \begin{vmatrix}2 - \lambda & 1 \\ 0 & 2 - \lambda\end{vmatrix} = (2 - \lambda)^2 = 0
$$

$$
\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = 2
$$

Finding eigenvectors: The null space of $A - \lambda I = \begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}$ is only one-dimensional.

The only eigenvector is $\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}$.

Since we have only one independent eigenvector for a 2×2 matrix, $A$ is **not diagonalizable**.

## Solving Difference Equations: $u_k = A^k u_0$

Many problems in science and engineering involve iterating a linear transformation:

- $u_1 = Au_0$
- $u_2 = Au_1 = A^2u_0$
- $u_k = A^k u_0$

### Solution Strategy

The key insight is to decompose $u_0$ in terms of eigenvectors:

$$
u_0 = c_1 x_1 + c_2 x_2 + \ldots + c_n x_n = SC
$$

where $C = \begin{bmatrix}c_1 \\ c_2 \\ \vdots \\ c_n\end{bmatrix}$ are the coefficients.

Applying $A$ to each eigenvector:

$$
Au_0 = \lambda_1 c_1 x_1 + \lambda_2 c_2 x_2 + \ldots + \lambda_n c_n x_n
$$

Applying $A$ a total of $k$ times:

$$
A^k u_0 = \lambda_1^k c_1 x_1 + \lambda_2^k c_2 x_2 + \ldots + \lambda_n^k c_n x_n = S\Lambda^k C
$$

This shows that each eigenvector component grows (or decays) exponentially at a rate determined by its eigenvalue.

## Fibonacci Example

### The Question

What is $F_{100}$ in the Fibonacci sequence $0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, \ldots$?

Computing this directly would require 100 additions, but eigenvalues give us a closed-form solution.

### The Trick: Convert to Matrix Form

The Fibonacci recurrence relation is:

$$
F_{k+2} = F_{k+1} + F_k
$$

We can convert this scalar recurrence into a vector equation. Define:

$$
u_k = \begin{bmatrix}F_{k+1} \\ F_k\end{bmatrix}
$$

Then:

$$
u_{k+1} = \begin{bmatrix}F_{k+2} \\ F_{k+1}\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}F_{k+1} + F_k \\ F_{k+1}\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}F_{k+1} \\ F_k\end{bmatrix} = Au_k
$$

So the Fibonacci sequence is generated by repeatedly multiplying by matrix $A = \begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}$.

### Finding Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

$$
|A - \lambda I| = \begin{vmatrix}1 - \lambda & 1 \\ 1 & -\lambda\end{vmatrix} = \lambda^2 - \lambda - 1 = 0
$$

From Vieta's formulas for a quadratic equation:

$$
\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 = 1
$$

$$
\lambda_1 \lambda_2 = -1
$$

Using the quadratic formula for $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

We get:

$$
\lambda = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}
$$

$$
\lambda_1 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 1.618 \quad \text{(the golden ratio!)}
$$

$$
\lambda_2 = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx -0.618
$$

### The Solution

Since $u_k = A^k u_0$, we can write:

$$
u_k = c_1 \lambda_1^k x_1 + c_2 \lambda_2^k x_2
$$

For large $k$:

$$
F_{100} \approx c_1 \left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^{100}
$$

Because $|\lambda_2| < 1$, the term $\lambda_2^{100}$ becomes negligibly small. The Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially at a rate determined by the golden ratio!

**Key insight**: The eigenvalues tell us the long-term behavior. The dominant eigenvalue $\lambda_1 \approx 1.618$ determines how fast the Fibonacci sequence grows, while the smaller eigenvalue $|\lambda_2| < 1$ contributes a rapidly decaying oscillation that becomes negligible for large $k$.
