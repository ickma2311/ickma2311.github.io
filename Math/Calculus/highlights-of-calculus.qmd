# Derivatives: rates of change

Calculus connects a function to its **rate of change**. The derivative tells us how fast $y$ changes when $x$ changes.

## Basic rules

- **Constant**: $\dfrac{d}{dx}(u+c)=\dfrac{du}{dx}$
- **Sum**: $\dfrac{d}{dx}(u+v)=\dfrac{du}{dx}+\dfrac{dv}{dx}$
- **Product**: $\dfrac{d}{dx}(uv)=u\,\dfrac{dv}{dx}+v\,\dfrac{du}{dx}$

## Three example functions

- Linear: $y=2x$ (constant growth)
- Quadratic: $y=x^2$ (growth increases with $x$)
- Exponential: $y=2^x$ (growth increases explosively)

These have very different growth rates, even though they all increase.

# Calculating change

There are two perspectives on change:

- **Limits**: $\dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$, then take $\Delta x\to 0$
- **Rules**: start from known derivatives and build new ones

For a linear combination,
$$
\frac{d}{dx}(C_1y_1+C_2y_2)=C_1\frac{dy_1}{dx}+C_2\frac{dy_2}{dx}.
$$

Example: if $y=x^2-1$, then $\dfrac{dy}{dx}=2x$.

# Slope and the tangent line

The **average slope** between two points is
$$
\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}.
$$
The **instantaneous slope** is the limit as $\Delta x\to 0$.

For $y=x^2$,
$$
\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=
\frac{(x+\Delta x)^2-x^2}{\Delta x}=2x+\Delta x
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\frac{dy}{dx}=2x.
$$

This produces the **linear approximation** near $x_0$:
$$
y\approx y_0+\frac{dy}{dx}(x_0)(x-x_0).
$$

## Second derivative

The **second derivative** is the slope of the slope.
If $y=x^2$, then $\dfrac{dy}{dx}=2x$ and $\dfrac{d^2y}{dx^2}=2$.
It tells us whether the function is speeding up or slowing down.

# Power rule

For $y=x^n$,
$$
\frac{dy}{dx}=n x^{n-1}.
$$

Examples:
- $y=x^2 \Rightarrow \dfrac{dy}{dx}=2x$
- $y=x^3 \Rightarrow \dfrac{dy}{dx}=3x^2$
- $y=x^4 \Rightarrow \dfrac{dy}{dx}=4x^3$

**Sketch of proof (induction):**
Assume $\dfrac{d}{dx}x^n=nx^{n-1}$. Then
$$
\frac{d}{dx}(x\cdot x^n)=1\cdot x^n + x\cdot (n x^{n-1})=(n+1)x^n.
$$

# Exponential function

The exponential function $y=e^x$ solves
$$
\frac{dy}{dx}=y.
$$
It equals its own slope.

Series expansion:
$$
e^1=e=1+1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{24}+\dots
$$

Key rules:
- $e^{x_1}e^{x_2}=e^{x_1+x_2}$
- $(e^x)^n=e^{xn}$

# Maxima and minima

To find extrema of $y=f(x)$, solve
$$
\frac{dy}{dx}=0
$$
for **critical points**. The second derivative distinguishes max vs. min.

# Integrals: accumulation

If the derivative is speed, the integral is distance.
If the derivative is a rate, the integral is the total effect.

The graph already contains the integral:
**the area under the curve measures accumulation.**

# Graphs as reasoning tools

In *Highlights of Calculus*, graphs are not for decoration—they are reasoning tools.
Slope reveals the first derivative, concavity reveals the second derivative,
and extrema and inflection points become visible directly from shape.

**Takeaway.** Calculus links pairs: a function and its derivative, or a rate and its accumulation. These connections let us read change from shape and compute global behavior from local rules.
