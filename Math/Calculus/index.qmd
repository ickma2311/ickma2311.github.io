**[Gilbert Strang's Calculus: Big Picture Integral](big-picture-integral.qmd)**
Connect derivatives and integrals through sums, differences, and area accumulation; then verify with a worked example from slope to distance.

**[Gilbert Strang's Calculus: The Exponential Function](exponential-function.qmd)**
Build $e^x$ from the condition $y'=y$, derive the factorial series coefficients, and connect the limit $(1+1/N)^N$ to continuous compounding.

**[Gilbert Strang's Calculus: Max, Min, and Second Derivative](max-min-second-derivative.qmd)**
Use first and second derivatives to classify extrema and find inflection points, with worked examples from $\sin x$ and a cubic.

**[Gilbert Strang's Calculus: Big Picture on Derivatives](big-picture-derivatives.qmd)**
A compact map of derivatives through slopes, limits, and the core function families: power, trigonometric, and exponential.
