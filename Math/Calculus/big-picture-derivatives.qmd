# Why derivatives matter

Derivatives connect a function to its local behavior: **how fast it changes** and **which way it is heading**. This note is a compact map of that idea using the most important functions and the slope viewpoint.

# The great functions

These are the core families you keep seeing in calculus:

- **Power**: $y=x^n$
  - $\dfrac{dy}{dx}=n x^{n-1}$
- **Trigonometric**:
  - $y=\sin x \Rightarrow \dfrac{dy}{dx}=\cos x$
  - $y=\cos x \Rightarrow \dfrac{dy}{dx}=-\sin x$
- **Exponential**:
  - $y=e^x \Rightarrow \dfrac{dy}{dx}=e^x$

# Slope: average vs. instantaneous

Slope is the change in $y$ over the change in $x$.

**Average slope** over a small step $\Delta x$:
$$
\text{Average slope} = \frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}
$$

**Instantaneous slope** is the limit as $\Delta x \to 0$:
$$
\frac{dy}{dx}=\lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}
$$

At the bottom of a curve, the slope is zero.

## Example: $f(x)=x^2$

Compute the instantaneous slope:
$$
\lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\frac{(x+\Delta x)^2-x^2}{\Delta x}
=\lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\frac{2x\Delta x+\Delta x^2}{\Delta x}
=2x
$$

So $f'(x)=2x$.

# Function and derivative

Derivatives are functions too. A curve and its slope curve tell a two-part story.

- $f(x)=x^2$ and $f'(x)=2x$

- $f(x)=\sin x$ and $f'(x)=\cos x$

**Takeaway.** The derivative is the bridge from shape to change. Once you know the core functions and the slope limit, you can read local behavior directly from a graph.
