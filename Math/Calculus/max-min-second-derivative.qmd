# Big idea

The **first derivative** locates where slope is zero (candidates for max or min). The **second derivative** tells the curve's bending direction, so we can decide whether that point is a maximum or minimum.

# Speed, slope, and acceleration

- **Position/height**: $f(t)$ describes where you are.
- **Speed/slope**: $f'(t)$ is the instantaneous rate of change.
- **Acceleration/bending**: $f''(t)$ tells how the slope itself changes.

Example: if $f(x)=x^2$, then
$$
f'(x)=2x,\qquad f''(x)=2.
$$
The constant positive second derivative says the curve bends upward everywhere.

# Convex, concave, and inflection

- If $f''(x) > 0$, the slope is increasing and the graph bends **upward** (convex).
- If $f''(x) < 0$, the slope is decreasing and the graph bends **downward** (concave).
- An **inflection point** is where the bending changes direction, typically where $f''(x)=0$.

# Example 1: $y=\sin x$

- $y' = \cos x$
- $y'' = -\sin x$

## Maximum

At $x=\pi/2$, $y=1$ and $y'=0$. Since $y''=-1<0$, the curve bends downward, so this is a **local maximum**.

## Inflection point

At $x=\pi$, $y''=0$ and the bending changes sign. This is an **inflection point**.

## Minimum

At $x=3\pi/2$, $y=-1$ and $y'=0$. Since $y''=1>0$, the curve bends upward, so this is a **local minimum**.

# Example 2: $y=x^3-x^2$

- $y' = 3x^2-2x = x(3x-2)$
- $y'' = 6x-2$

Set $y'=0$:
$$
3x^2-2x=0 \quad\Rightarrow\quad x=0,\; x=\tfrac{2}{3}.
$$

- At $x=0$, $y''=-2<0$, so this is a **local maximum**.
- At $x=\tfrac{2}{3}$, $y''=2>0$, so this is a **local minimum**.

The inflection point is where $y''=0$:
$$
6x-2=0 \Rightarrow x=\tfrac{1}{3}.
$$

**Takeaway.** First derivative = where the slope is zero. Second derivative = which way the curve bends. Together they classify maxima, minima, and inflection points.
