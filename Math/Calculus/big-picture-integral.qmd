Integrals and derivatives can be mostly explained by working (very briefly) with sums and differences.  
- Gilbert Strang

# The connection between two functions

The key connection is between a height/distance function and a slope function.
This pair is a two-way map: derivative gives local change from total accumulation, and integral rebuilds total accumulation from local change (up to an initial value).

- Height/Distance function: $y(x)$  
This function represents accumulated height or distance.
- Slope function:
$$
s(x)=\frac{dy}{dx}=\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}
$$
This function represents the instantaneous rate of change (for distance-time, this is speed).

Examples:

- If $y=x^n$, then $\frac{dy}{dx}=nx^{n-1}$.
- If $\frac{dy}{dx}=x^n$, then
$$
y(x)=\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}+C.
$$

# From slope to distance

Suppose we know the slope each hour and want distance back.

Hourly slopes:
$$
4,\ 3,\ 2,\ 1,\ 0.
$$

Cumulative distance:

- Hour 1: $4$
- Hour 2: $4+3=7$
- Hour 3: $7+2=9$
- Hour 4: $9+1=10$
- Hour 5: $10+0=10$

From an algebra view, sample distance at times as $y_0,y_1,y_2,\dots,y_n$.
Then each increment is:
$$
\Delta y_k=y_k-y_{k-1}.
$$
Summing all increments gives:
$$
\sum_{k=1}^n \Delta y_k
=(y_1-y_0)+(y_2-y_1)+\cdots+(y_n-y_{n-1})
=y_n-y_0.
$$

This is exactly “final value minus initial value.”

Another equivalent form is:
$$
\sum \left(\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\right)\Delta x = y_{\text{last}}-y_{\text{first}}.
$$

As $\Delta x$ gets smaller and smaller, $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ approaches the slope function $\frac{dy}{dx}$.

The answer is as simple as changing $\sum$ to $\int$:

$$
\int s(x)\,dx.
$$

Here $s(x)$ is the slope, and $dx$ is an infinitesimal change in $x$. Geometrically, this is accumulated area under the slope curve.

# Example

Slope function:
$$
s(x)=2-2x.
$$

This starts at 2 (when $x=0$) and drops to 0 (when $x=1$).
To get height/distance, we can first look at a discrete approximation, then the integral limit.

## Discrete point of view

Split $[0,1]$ into 4 equal intervals, so $\Delta x=\frac14$.
Use left endpoints as piecewise-constant speeds.

Speeds at left endpoints:

- $x=0$: $2$
- $x=\frac14$: $1.5$
- $x=\frac12$: $1$
- $x=\frac34$: $0.5$

Left Riemann sum:
$$
2\Delta x+1.5\Delta x+1\Delta x+0.5\Delta x
=5\Delta x=\frac54=1.25.
$$

Observation:

- Inside each interval, slope is decreasing.
- Using the left endpoint gives a larger rectangle than the true area.
- So this is an overestimate.

Now use smaller intervals, for example $\Delta x=\frac18$:
$$
2\Delta x+1.75\Delta x+1.5\Delta x+1.25\Delta x+1\Delta x+0.75\Delta x+0.5\Delta x+0.25\Delta x
=9\Delta x=\frac98=1.125.
$$

The estimate gets closer as $\Delta x\to 0$.

## Integral point of view

From the discrete view, smaller $\Delta x$ gives better accuracy.
In the limit, rectangles become infinitesimally thin, and the sum becomes the exact area:
$$
\int_0^x (2-2t)\,dt.
$$

![Area interpretation in the limit](big-picture-integral-2.png)

Areas:

- At $x=1$: area is triangle area
$$
\frac{1\cdot 2}{2}=1.
$$
- At $x=0.5$: area can be computed either as
  - big triangle minus small triangle, or
  - trapezoid area from $x=0$ to $x=0.5$.

Both give $0.75$.

## Proof

Find an antiderivative of $s(x)=2-2x$:
$$
y(x)=2x-x^2+C.
$$
If we set $y(0)=0$, then $C=0$, so
$$
y(x)=2x-x^2.
$$

Check:

- $x=1$: $y(1)=2(1)-1^2=1$
- $x=0.5$: $y(0.5)=2(0.5)-(0.5)^2=1-0.25=0.75$

So the integral view and algebraic antiderivative match exactly.
