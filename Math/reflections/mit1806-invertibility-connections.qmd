## Introduction

In linear algebra, concepts like invertibility, null space, linear independence, rank, and pivots often seem like separate topics. However, they are deeply interconnected - different views of the same mathematical reality. This post synthesizes these fundamental concepts and reveals how they all tell the same story about whether a linear transformation preserves information.

## Invertibility: The Foundation

**Reference**: [Lecture 3: Matrix Multiplication and Inverse](https://ickma2311.github.io/Math/mit1806-lecture3-multiplication.html)

### Definition

A square matrix $A$ is **invertible** if there exists a matrix $A^{-1}$ such that:

$$
AA^{-1} = A^{-1}A = I_n
$$

### Properties of Invertible Matrices

An invertible matrix $A$ must satisfy:

- **Square**: $m = n$ (same number of rows and columns)
- **Full rank**: $\text{rank}(A) = n$
- **All pivot variables**: $r = n$ pivot positions
- **No free variables**: $n - r = 0$ free variables
- **Independent rows**: All rows are linearly independent

### Solving Systems with Invertible Matrices

When $A$ is invertible, solving $Ax = b$ becomes straightforward:

$$
\begin{aligned}
Ax &= b \\
A^{-1}Ax &= A^{-1}b \\
x &= A^{-1}b
\end{aligned}
$$

The solution is **unique** and exists for **every** $b$.

## Null Space: A Direct Test for Invertibility

**Reference**: [Lecture 7: Solving Ax=0](https://ickma2311.github.io/Math/mit1806-lecture7-solving-ax-0.html)

### The Connection

The null space $N(A)$ provides a direct test for invertibility:

- **If $N(A) = \{\mathbf{0}\}$**: Matrix is invertible
- **If $N(A) \neq \{\mathbf{0}\}$**: Matrix is NOT invertible

### Why Non-Trivial Null Space Prevents Invertibility

**Proof by contradiction**:

Suppose $N(A) \neq \{\mathbf{0}\}$ and $A^{-1}$ exists. Let $v_1 \in N(A)$ with $v_1 \neq \mathbf{0}$.

Then:

$$
\begin{aligned}
Av_1 &= \mathbf{0} \quad \text{(by definition of null space)} \\
A^{-1}(Av_1) &= A^{-1}\mathbf{0} \quad \text{(multiply both sides by } A^{-1}\text{)} \\
(A^{-1}A)v_1 &= \mathbf{0} \\
I_n v_1 &= \mathbf{0} \\
v_1 &= \mathbf{0}
\end{aligned}
$$

**Contradiction!** We assumed $v_1 \neq \mathbf{0}$, but our logic forces $v_1 = \mathbf{0}$.

Therefore, $A^{-1}$ cannot exist when $N(A)$ contains non-zero vectors.

## Key Insight
A non-trivial null space means **information is lost** in the transformation $A$, making it impossible to uniquely reverse.

## Linear Independence: The Geometric View

**Reference**: [Lecture 8: Solving Ax=b](https://ickma2311.github.io/Math/mit1806-lecture8-solving-ax-b.html)

### Connection to Invertibility

If the rows (or columns) of a matrix are not all linearly independent, the matrix cannot be invertible.

**For a square matrix**:

- Independent rows/columns ⟺ $\text{rank}(A) = n$
- Dependent rows/columns ⟺ $\text{rank}(A) < n$

### Why Dependence Prevents Invertibility

When rows are dependent:

- **Rank**: $r < n$ (not full rank)
- **Pivots**: Only $r < n$ pivot positions
- **Free variables**: $n - r > 0$ free variables exist

#### Two Perspectives on Dependence

**1. Algebraic Perspective**

When free variables exist:

$$
R_{\text{rref}} = [I_r \mid F]
$$

where $F$ is the $(n-r)$-dimensional free variable matrix.

The null space $N(A)$ has dimension $n - r > 0$, containing infinitely many vectors. By our earlier proof, this means $A$ is not invertible.

**2. Geometric Perspective**

If rows are dependent, the transformation $A$ collapses the $n$-dimensional space down to an $r$-dimensional subspace (where $r < n$).

- **Information loss**: The transformation maps multiple distinct inputs to the same output
- **Cannot invert**: We cannot uniquely recover the original $n$-dimensional vector from its $r$-dimensional image
- **Missing dimensions**: The $(n-r)$ dimensions of information are permanently lost

::: {.callout-note}
## Example: Dimensional Collapse
A $3 \times 3$ matrix with rank 2 maps all of $\mathbb{R}^3$ onto a 2-dimensional plane. Infinitely many points in 3D space map to each point on the plane. There's no way to uniquely invert this mapping.

## The Big Picture: Everything is Connected

All these concepts are different views of the same mathematical reality:

| Perspective | Invertible ($A^{-1}$ exists) | Not Invertible ($A^{-1}$ doesn't exist) |
|-------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Null Space** | $N(A) = \{\mathbf{0}\}$ | $N(A) \neq \{\mathbf{0}\}$ |
| **Rank** | $\text{rank}(A) = n$ (full rank) | $\text{rank}(A) < n$ (rank deficient) |
| **Pivots** | $n$ pivots (all columns) | $r < n$ pivots |
| **Free Variables** | 0 free variables | $n - r > 0$ free variables |
| **Independence** | Rows/columns independent | Rows/columns dependent |
| **Dimension** | $\dim(N(A)) = 0$ | $\dim(N(A)) = n - r > 0$ |
| **Solutions to $Ax = 0$** | Only $x = \mathbf{0}$ | Infinitely many solutions |
| **Determinant** | $\det(A) \neq 0$ | $\det(A) = 0$ |

## Fundamental Theorem of Invertible Matrices

For a square $n \times n$ matrix $A$, the following are **equivalent** (all true or all false):

1. $A$ is invertible
2. $A^{-1}$ exists
3. $\text{rank}(A) = n$
4. $N(A) = \{\mathbf{0}\}$
5. Columns of $A$ are linearly independent
6. Rows of $A$ are linearly independent
7. $\det(A) \neq 0$
8. $Ax = 0$ has only the trivial solution
9. $Ax = b$ has a unique solution for every $b$
10. $A$ has $n$ pivot positions

::: {.callout-important}
## The Core Insight
All these conditions are testing whether the linear transformation **preserves information**. If any information is lost (through dimensional collapse, non-trivial null space, or linear dependence), the transformation cannot be inverted.
