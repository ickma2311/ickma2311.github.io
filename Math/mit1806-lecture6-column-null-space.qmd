## Context

[My lecture notes](https://github.com/ickma2311/foundations/blob/main/MIT18.06SC/lecture06/lecture06_column_space_and_null_space.md)

Column space and null space are two fundamental subspaces associated with any matrix. This lecture shows which vectors $b$ make $Ax = b$ solvable and which vectors $x$ satisfy $Ax = 0$.

## Subspace Properties

- $P \cup L$ is **not** a subspace (P and L are two subspaces)
- $P \cap L$ **is** a subspace

## Column Space

### Definition

Given a matrix A:
$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 2 \\
2 & 1 & 3 \\
3 & 1 & 4 \\
4 & 1 & 5
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The **column space** of A consists of all possible linear combinations of the columns of A.

### Key Observation

Because the column space has 4 dimensions (rows) but only 3 columns (subspaces/lines), the entire space cannot be filled. There are many vectors $b$ outside the column space.

**Therefore:** We **cannot** say that for every $Ax = b$, there is a solution.

### Solutions to $Ax = b$

#### Special Case: $b = \mathbf{0}$

- $b = [0, 0, 0, 0]$ **always has a solution**
- This is the origin point, and all subspaces pass through the origin
- The solution is $x = [0, 0, 0]$

#### Which $b$ Can Be Solved?

**General Rule:** $Ax = b$ has a solution **if and only if** $b$ is in the column space of A.

#### Examples of Solvable $b$:

1. $b = [1, 2, 3, 4]$ has solution $x = [1, 0, 0]$
   - This is the first column of A

2. $b = [1, 1, 1, 1]$ has solution $x = [0, 1, 0]$
   - This is the second column of A

3. Any linear combination of columns has a solution
   - If $b = c_1 \cdot \text{col}_1 + c_2 \cdot \text{col}_2 + c_3 \cdot \text{col}_3$
   - Then $x = [c_1, c_2, c_3]$ is the solution

## Null Space

### Definition

The **null space** of A, denoted $N(A)$, contains all vectors $x$ that satisfy:
$$
Ax = \mathbf{0}
$$

### Proof: $N(A)$ is a Subspace

To prove that the null space is a subspace, we must show it satisfies two properties:

#### 1. Closed Under Addition

If $v$ and $w$ are in $N(A)$, then $v + w$ is also in $N(A)$.

**Proof:**
$$
\begin{align}
Av &= \mathbf{0} \\
Aw &= \mathbf{0} \\
A(v + w) &= Av + Aw = \mathbf{0} + \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{0}
\end{align}
$$

Therefore, $v + w \in N(A)$.

#### 2. Closed Under Scalar Multiplication

If $x$ is in $N(A)$ and $c$ is any scalar, then $cx$ is also in $N(A)$.

**Proof:**
$$
\begin{align}
Ax &= \mathbf{0} \\
A(cx) &= c(Ax) = c \cdot \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{0}
\end{align}
$$

Therefore, $cx \in N(A)$.

### Important Contrast: When $b \neq \mathbf{0}$

The solution set of $Ax = b$ (when $b \neq \mathbf{0}$) is **not** a subspace.

#### Proof: Not Closed Under Scalar Multiplication

**Given:**
$$
Ax = b, \quad b \neq \mathbf{0}
$$

**For scalar $c \neq 1$:**
$$
A(cx) = c(Ax) = cb \neq b
$$

Therefore, if $x$ is a solution, $cx$ is **not** a solution (unless $c = 1$).

**Conclusion:** The solution set fails the scalar multiplication property, so it is not a subspace.

## Summary

**Column Space:**
- **Column space** = all possible linear combinations of columns
- $Ax = b$ is solvable $\Leftrightarrow$ $b$ is in the column space
- Not every $b \in \mathbb{R}^4$ is in the column space of this particular A

**Null Space:**
- **Null space** $N(A) = \{x : Ax = \mathbf{0}\}$ **is** a subspace
- Solution set of $Ax = b$ (when $b \neq \mathbf{0}$) is **not** a subspace
- The null space always contains the zero vector
- The null space is closed under addition and scalar multiplication
