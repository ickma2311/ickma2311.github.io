## Context

[My lecture notes](https://github.com/ickma2311/foundations/blob/main/MIT18.06SC/lecture08/lecture08_solving_Ax_equals_b.md)

This lecture presents the complete solution structure for $Ax = b$ and classifies all linear systems into four cases based on rank: exactly determined (unique solution), overdetermined (0 or 1 solution), underdetermined (infinite solutions), and rank deficient (0 or infinite solutions).

## Complete Solution Structure

The general solution to $Ax = b$ (when it exists) has the form:
$$
x = x_p + x_n
$$

where:
- $x_p$ is a **particular solution**: any specific solution satisfying $Ax_p = b$
- $x_n$ is any vector from the **null space**: $Ax_n = 0$

### Why This Works

$$
\begin{aligned}
Ax_p &= b \\
Ax_n &= 0 \\
\hline
A(x_p + x_n) &= Ax_p + Ax_n = b + 0 = b
\end{aligned}
$$

**Key insight**: The complete solution is the particular solution plus the entire null space.

## Finding a Particular Solution

### Algorithm
1. Row reduce $[A \mid b]$ to reduced row echelon form
2. Set all **free variables** to 0
3. Solve for the **pivot variables** from the reduced equations
4. This gives $x_p$

If row reduction produces a row like $[0 \, 0 \, \cdots \, 0 \mid c]$ where $c \neq 0$, then no solution exists.

## Rank and Solution Existence

For an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ with rank $r$:

$$
r \leq \min(m, n)
$$

This is because:
- $r \leq m$ (rank cannot exceed number of rows)
- $r \leq n$ (rank cannot exceed number of columns)

### Solvability Condition

The system $Ax = b$ has a solution **if and only if** $b$ is in the column space of $A$:
$$
b \in C(A)
$$

Equivalently, the system is solvable when $\text{rank}(A) = \text{rank}([A \mid b])$.

## Four Cases Based on Rank

### Case 1: Exactly Determined (Square, Full Rank)

**Conditions**: $r = n = m$ (square matrix with full rank)

**Properties**:
- Matrix is **invertible**
- RREF: $R = I_n$ (identity matrix)
- No free variables
- Null space: $N(A) = \{\vec{0}\}$ (only zero vector)

**Solutions**:
- **Unique solution** for every $b$: $x = A^{-1}b$
- Number of solutions = 1 (always)

**Example**:
$$
A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}, \quad r = 2 = m = n
$$

### Case 2: Overdetermined (Tall, Full Column Rank)

**Conditions**: $m > n$ and $r = n$ (more equations than unknowns)

**Properties**:
- Matrix is **tall and skinny**
- RREF: $R = \begin{bmatrix} I_n \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$ (identity on top, zeros below)
- No free variables ($n - r = 0$)
- Null space: $N(A) = \{\vec{0}\}$ (only zero vector)

**Solutions**:
- **0 or 1 solution** (depends on whether $b \in C(A)$)
- If solution exists, it is unique (no free variables)
- Most $b$ vectors have **no solution** (overconstrained system)

**Example**:
$$
A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \\ 5 & 6 \end{bmatrix}, \quad r = 2, \, m = 3, \, n = 2
$$

**Interpretation**: More constraints than degrees of freedom; typically no exact solution (leads to least squares in practice).

### Case 3: Underdetermined (Wide, Full Row Rank)

**Conditions**: $m < n$ and $r = m$ (fewer equations than unknowns)

**Properties**:
- Matrix is **short and wide**
- RREF: $R = [I_m \mid F]$ (identity on left, free columns on right)
- Has free variables ($n - r = n - m > 0$)
- Non-trivial null space: $\dim(N(A)) = n - m$

**Solutions**:
- **Infinitely many solutions** for every $b$ (when $r = m$)
- Solution exists because $C(A) = \mathbb{R}^m$ (full row rank)
- Complete solution: $x = x_p + x_n$ where $x_n$ ranges over $(n-m)$-dimensional null space

**Example**:
$$
A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 2 \end{bmatrix}, \quad r = 2, \, m = 2, \, n = 4
$$

**Interpretation**: More degrees of freedom than constraints; infinitely many ways to satisfy the equations.

### Case 4: Rank Deficient (Neither Full Column nor Full Row Rank)

**Conditions**: $r < m$ and $r < n$ (rank deficient)

**Properties**:
- Has free variables: $n - r > 0$
- Column space is proper subspace: $C(A) \subsetneq \mathbb{R}^m$

**Solutions**:
- **0 or infinitely many solutions**
- If $b \in C(A)$: infinitely many solutions (due to non-trivial null space)
- If $b \notin C(A)$: no solution

**Example**:
$$
A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 2 & 4 & 6 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad r = 1, \, m = 3, \, n = 3
$$

## Summary Table

| Case | Rank Condition | Matrix Shape | # Free Vars | # Solutions |
|------|---------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Exactly determined | $r = n = m$ | Square, invertible | 0 | 1 (always) |
| Overdetermined | $r = n < m$ | Tall, full column rank | 0 | 0 or 1 |
| Underdetermined | $r = m < n$ | Wide, full row rank | $n - m$ | $\infty$ (always) |
| Rank deficient | $r < \min(m,n)$ | General | $n - r > 0$ | 0 or $\infty$ |

**Key principle**:
- Number of free variables = $n - r$
- If $r = n$: 0 or 1 solution (unique if exists)
- If $r < n$: 0 or $\infty$ solutions (null space is non-trivial)
