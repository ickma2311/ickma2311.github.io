## Context

[My lecture notes](https://github.com/ickma2311/foundations/blob/main/MIT18.06SC/lecture05/5.2_transpose.md)

The transpose operation switches rows to columns. This post covers the transpose portion of Lecture 5.

## Definition

**Transpose** is the operation that switches rows to columns - each $A_{i,j}$ becomes $A_{j,i}$

For a matrix $A$, the transpose $A^T$ satisfies:
$$
(A^T)_{i,j} = A_{j,i}
$$

## Symmetric Matrices

A **symmetric matrix** satisfies $A = A^T$

### Property: $RR^T$ is Symmetric

For any matrix $R$, the product $RR^T$ is always symmetric.

**Proof:**
$$
(RR^T)^T = (R^T)^T R^T = RR^T
$$

Therefore, $RR^T$ is symmetric.
