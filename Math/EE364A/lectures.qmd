**[Lecture 1: Introduction to Convex Optimization](ee364a-lecture1-intro.qmd)**
Introduction to constraint optimization problems: least squares ($\|Ax-b\|_2^2$), linear programming ($c^\top x$ with linear constraints), and convex optimization (convex objective and constraints). Convex optimization generalizes both while maintaining polynomial-time solvability: $O(\max(n^3, n^2m, F))$ where $F$ is derivative computation cost.
