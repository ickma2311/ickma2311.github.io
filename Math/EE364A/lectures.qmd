**[Lecture 1: Introduction to Convex Optimization](ee364a-lecture1-intro.qmd)**
Introduction to constraint optimization problems: least squares ($\|Ax-b\|_2^2$), linear programming ($c^\top x$ with linear constraints), and convex optimization (convex objective and constraints). Convex optimization generalizes both while maintaining polynomial-time solvability: $O(\max(n^3, n^2m, F))$ where $F$ is derivative computation cost.

**[Lecture 2: Convex Sets](ee364a-lecture2-math-foundations.qmd)**
Convex sets (affine combinations, convex combinations, convex hull, convex cone), hyperplanes and halfspaces, Euclidean balls and ellipsoids, norm balls and norm cones (including second-order cone), polyhedra, positive semidefinite cone, operations preserving convexity (intersection, affine functions, perspective, linear-fractional), generalized inequalities (proper cones, componentwise and matrix inequalities), and minimum vs minimal elements.

**[Lecture 3: Convex Functions](ee364a-lecture3-convex-functions.qmd)**
Separating and supporting hyperplane theorems, dual cones and generalized inequalities, convex function definition, first-order condition (tangent underestimates), second-order condition (Hessian PSD), extended value extension, restriction to a line, epigraph and sublevel sets, Jensen's inequality, and operations preserving convexity (nonnegative sums, affine composition, pointwise maximum).
