**[Lecture 1: Introduction to Convex Optimization](ee364a-lecture1-intro.qmd)**
Introduction to constraint optimization problems: least squares ($\|Ax-b\|_2^2$), linear programming ($c^\top x$ with linear constraints), and convex optimization (convex objective and constraints). Convex optimization generalizes both while maintaining polynomial-time solvability: $O(\max(n^3, n^2m, F))$ where $F$ is derivative computation cost.

**[Lecture 2: Convex Sets](ee364a-lecture2-math-foundations.qmd)**
Convex sets (affine combinations, convex combinations, convex hull, convex cone), hyperplanes and halfspaces, Euclidean balls and ellipsoids, norm balls and norm cones (including second-order cone), polyhedra, positive semidefinite cone, operations preserving convexity (intersection, affine functions, perspective, linear-fractional), generalized inequalities (proper cones, componentwise and matrix inequalities), and minimum vs minimal elements.

**[Lecture 3: Convex Functions](ee364a-lecture3-convex-functions.qmd)**
Separating and supporting hyperplane theorems, dual cones and generalized inequalities, convex function definition, first-order condition (tangent underestimates), second-order condition (Hessian PSD), extended value extension, restriction to a line, epigraph and sublevel sets, Jensen's inequality, and operations preserving convexity (nonnegative sums, affine composition, pointwise maximum).

**[Lecture 4 Part 1: Operations preserving Convexity](ee364a-lecture4-part1-operations-preserving-convexity.qmd)**
Pointwise maximum and supremum (support function, distance to farthest point, maximum eigenvalue), composition with scalar functions (exponential, reciprocal), vector composition (log-sum-exp), minimization over convex sets (Schur complement, distance to set), and perspective functions with examples.

**[Lecture 4 Part 2: Conjugate and Quasiconvex Functions](ee364a-lecture4-part2-conjugate-quasiconvex.qmd)**
Conjugate functions $f^*(y) = \sup_x (y^\top x - f(x))$ are always convex, with examples including negative logarithm and quadratic functions. Quasiconvex functions have convex sublevel sets with modified Jensen inequality $f(\theta x + (1-\theta)y) \leq \max\{f(x), f(y)\}$. Examples include linear-fractional functions and distance ratios.
