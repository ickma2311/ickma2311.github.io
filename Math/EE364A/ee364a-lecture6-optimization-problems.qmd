## Basic Terminology and Notation

An optimization problem in standard form is written as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{minimize } \quad & f_0(x) \\
\text{subject to } \quad & f_i(x) \le 0, \quad i=1,...,m \\
& h_i(x) = 0, \quad i=1,...,p
\end{aligned}
$$

### Key Components

- **Decision variable**: $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ — the variable we optimize over
- **Objective function** (or cost function): $f_0: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ — the function we want to minimize
- **Inequality constraints**: $f_i: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}, \quad i=1,...,m$
- **Equality constraints**: $h_i: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}, \quad i=1,...,p$

### Domain and Feasibility

The **domain** $\mathcal{D}$ of the optimization problem is:

$$
\mathcal{D} = \bigcap_{i=0}^{m} \mathrm{dom} f_i \cap \bigcap_{i=1}^{p} \mathrm{dom} h_i
$$

A point $x \in \mathcal{D}$ is **feasible** if it satisfies all constraints:

$$
f_i(x) \le 0, \quad i=1,...,m, \qquad h_i(x) = 0, \quad i=1,...,p
$$

The **feasible set** (or constraint set) is the set of all feasible points.

If the problem has at least one feasible point, we say the problem is **feasible**; otherwise it is **infeasible**.

### Optimal Values

The **optimal value** $p^*$ of the problem is defined as:

$$
p^* = \inf \{f_0(x) \mid f_i(x) \le 0, i=1,...,m, \, h_i(x) = 0, i=1,...,p\}
$$

- If the problem is infeasible, $p^* = +\infty$ (by convention)
- If there are feasible points $x_k$ with $f_0(x_k) \to -\infty$, we say $p^* = -\infty$ and the problem is **unbounded below**

A feasible point $x^*$ is **optimal** (or a **solution** to the problem) if $f_0(x^*) = p^*$.

The set of all optimal points is the **optimal set**, denoted $X_{\mathrm{opt}}$:

$$
X_{\mathrm{opt}} = \{x \mid f_i(x) \le 0, i=1,...,m, \, h_i(x) = 0, i=1,...,p, \, f_0(x) = p^*\}
$$

If $X_{\mathrm{opt}}$ is empty, we say the optimal value is **not attained** or **not achieved**.

### Local Optimality

A feasible point $x$ is **locally optimal** if there exists an $R > 0$ such that:

$$
f_0(x) = \inf \{f_0(z) \mid f_i(z) \le 0, i=1,...,m, \, h_i(z) = 0, i=1,...,p, \, \|z-x\|_2 \le R\}
$$

In other words, $x$ minimizes $f_0$ over nearby feasible points.

## Global vs Local Optimality
For convex optimization problems, any locally optimal point is globally optimal. This is one of the key advantages of convex optimization.

## Standard Form for Optimization Problems

A general optimization problem can be converted to **standard form**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{minimize } \quad & f_0(x) \\
\text{subject to } \quad & f_i(x) \le 0, \quad i=1,...,m \\
& Ax = b
\end{aligned}
$$

![Standard form structure](standard_form.png)

### Converting to Standard Form

Most optimization problems can be transformed to standard form through simple manipulations:

1. **Maximization problems**: Maximize $f_0(x)$ becomes minimize $-f_0(x)$

2. **Constraint inequalities**:
   - $f_i(x) \ge 0$ becomes $-f_i(x) \le 0$
   - $f_i(x) < 0$ becomes $f_i(x) \le 0$ (strict inequalities are converted to non-strict)

3. **Equality constraints**:
   - $h_i(x) = 0$ can be expressed as two inequalities: $h_i(x) \le 0$ and $-h_i(x) \le 0$
   - Or equivalently: $|h_i(x)| \le 0$

## Equivalent Problems

Two optimization problems are **equivalent** if from the solution of one, a solution of the other is readily found, and vice versa.

### Common Equivalence Transformations

#### 1. Change of Variables

If $\phi: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is one-to-one with image covering the problem domain, then:

**Original problem:**
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{minimize } \quad & f_0(x) \\
\text{subject to } \quad & f_i(x) \le 0, \quad i=1,...,m \\
& h_i(x) = 0, \quad i=1,...,p
\end{aligned}
$$

**Equivalent problem** (with $x = \phi(z)$):
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{minimize } \quad & f_0(\phi(z)) \\
\text{subject to } \quad & f_i(\phi(z)) \le 0, \quad i=1,...,m \\
& h_i(\phi(z)) = 0, \quad i=1,...,p
\end{aligned}
$$

#### 2. Transformation of Objective and Constraint Functions

If $\psi_0: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is monotone increasing, the problems:

- Minimize $f_0(x)$
- Minimize $\psi_0(f_0(x))$

are equivalent.

**Example**: Minimizing $\|Ax-b\|_2$ is equivalent to minimizing $\|Ax-b\|_2^2$.

#### 3. Slack Variables

Inequality constraints $f_i(x) \le 0$ can be replaced by introducing **slack variables** $s_i$:

$$
f_i(x) + s_i = 0, \quad s_i \ge 0
$$

This converts inequality constraints to equality constraints plus nonnegativity constraints.

#### 4. Eliminating Equality Constraints

Linear equality constraints $Ax = b$ can be eliminated by solving for some variables in terms of others.

If $Ax = b$ has rank $p$, we can write:

$$
x = x_0 + Fu
$$

where $x_0$ is a particular solution and $F$ is a matrix whose columns form a basis for the nullspace of $A$.

The optimization problem becomes:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{minimize } \quad & f_0(x_0 + Fu) \\
\text{subject to } \quad & f_i(x_0 + Fu) \le 0, \quad i=1,...,m
\end{aligned}
$$

#### 5. Introducing New Variables and Constraints

We can sometimes simplify a problem by introducing **additional variables and constraints**.

**Example**: Minimize $\max_{i=1,...,m} f_i(x)$ is equivalent to:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{minimize } \quad & t \\
\text{subject to } \quad & f_i(x) \le t, \quad i=1,...,m
\end{aligned}
$$

#### 6. Epigraph Form

The optimization problem:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{minimize } \quad & f_0(x) \\
\text{subject to } \quad & f_i(x) \le 0, \quad i=1,...,m \\
& h_i(x) = 0, \quad i=1,...,p
\end{aligned}
$$

is equivalent to:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{minimize } \quad & t \\
\text{subject to } \quad & f_0(x) - t \le 0 \\
& f_i(x) \le 0, \quad i=1,...,m \\
& h_i(x) = 0, \quad i=1,...,p
\end{aligned}
$$

This is called the **epigraph form** because the variables $(x,t)$ range over the epigraph of $f_0$.

## Two Ways to Describe an Optimization Problem

### 1. Parameter Problem Description

The problem is described by **explicitly giving the functions** that appear:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{minimize } \quad & f_0(x) \\
\text{subject to } \quad & f_i(x) \le 0, \quad i=1,...,m \\
& h_i(x) = 0, \quad i=1,...,p
\end{aligned}
$$

**Example**: Least squares problem
$$
\text{minimize } \quad \|Ax-b\|_2^2
$$

where $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ and $b \in \mathbb{R}^m$ are the problem **parameters**.

### 2. Oracle Problem Description

The problem is described in terms of **oracles** (subroutines) that answer questions about the problem.

For example, an oracle might:
- Evaluate $f_i(x)$ at a given $x$
- Evaluate $\nabla f_i(x)$ at a given $x$
- Check feasibility of a point $x$

::: {.callout-note icon="💡"}
## Oracle vs Parameter Description

- **Parameter description**: More explicit, suitable for theoretical analysis and algorithm design
- **Oracle description**: More abstract, focuses on computational complexity and query efficiency

The choice between them depends on the context. Parameter descriptions are common in convex optimization, while oracle descriptions are more common in complexity theory and black-box optimization.

3. **Equivalent problems**: Transformations that preserve solutions including change of variables, monotone transformations, slack variables, constraint elimination, and epigraph form
4. **Problem descriptions**: Parameter descriptions (explicit functions) vs oracle descriptions (query interfaces)

These concepts form the foundation for studying convex optimization in subsequent lectures.
