## Convex Problems in Standard Form

A convex optimization problem in standard form is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{minimize} \quad & f_0(x) \\
\text{subject to} \quad & f_i(x) \le 0, \quad i = 1,\dots,m \\
& a_i^\top x = b_i, \quad i = 1,\dots,p,
\end{aligned}
$$

where $f_0,\dots,f_m$ are convex and the equality constraints are affine. The feasible set is

$$
\mathcal{D} = \bigcap_{i=0}^m \mathrm{dom}\, f_i,
$$

which is convex because it is an intersection of convex sets. Affine equalities preserve convexity, so the feasible region remains convex.

## Why equality constraints must be affine
If $h(x) = 0$ is part of the feasible set, we need $h(\theta x + (1-\theta)y) = 0$ whenever $h(x)=h(y)=0$. This holds exactly when $h$ is affine: $h(\theta x + (1-\theta)y) = \theta h(x) + (1-\theta)h(y)$.

## Local vs Global Optimality

For convex problems, every local optimum is a global optimum. Sketch:

1. Assume $x$ is locally optimal inside a ball of radius $R$, so $f_0(x) \le f_0(z)$ for all feasible $z$ with $\|z-x\|_2 < R$.
2. Suppose there exists a feasible $y$ with $f_0(y) < f_0(x)$ (a better point outside the ball).
3. By convexity, points on the segment $z = (1-\theta)x + \theta y$ satisfy $f_0(z) < (1-\theta)f_0(x) + \theta f_0(y) < f_0(x)$ for $0 < \theta \le 1$.
4. For small $\theta$, $z$ stays inside the ball, contradicting local optimality.

Geometric takeaway: convexity rules out spurious local minima.

## First-Order Optimality (Differentiable $f_0$)

For differentiable $f_0$ and any $x,y \in \mathrm{dom}\, f_0$,

$$
f_0(y) \ge f_0(x) + \nabla f_0(x)^\top (y-x).
$$

A feasible point $x^\star$ is optimal iff

$$
\nabla f_0(x^\star)^\top (y - x^\star) \ge 0 \quad \forall y \text{ feasible}.
$$

- **Unconstrained:** $\nabla f_0(x^\star) = 0$.
- **Equality constraints $Ax=b$:** $\nabla f_0(x^\star)$ is orthogonal to the nullspace of $A$, so $\nabla f_0(x^\star) + A^\top v = 0$ for some $v$.
- **Nonnegative orthant ($x \succeq 0$):** $x \succeq 0$, $\nabla f_0(x) \succeq 0$, and $x_i (\nabla f_0(x))_i = 0$ (complementary slackness).

## Equivalent Convex Problems

Two convex problems are equivalent if solving one immediately yields a solution to the other.

- **Change of variables:** $x = Fz + x_0$ with $F$ spanning the nullspace of equality constraints removes those equalities.
- **Transforming objective/constraints:** Apply a monotone increasing function to $f_0$ or $f_i$ without changing the solution (e.g., minimize $\|Ax-b\|_2$ vs. $\|Ax-b\|_2^2$).
- **Slack variables:** Replace $a^\top x \le b$ by $a^\top x + s = b$, $s \ge 0$ to expose feasibility structure.
- **Epigraph form:** Introducing $t$ so that $f_0(x) \le t$ converts nonlinear objectives to constraints when useful for decomposition.

## Quasiconvex Problems and Bisection

A quasiconvex problem in standard form:

- Minimize $f_0(x)$ where $f_0$ is quasiconvex
- Subject to $f_i(x) \le 0$ (convex) and $Ax = b$

Quasiconvexity is characterized by convex sublevel sets. If a family of convex inequalities $\phi_t(x) \le 0$ satisfies $f_0(x) \le t \Leftrightarrow \phi_t(x) \le 0$, feasibility at level $t$ reveals whether $p^\star \le t$.

### Bisection on the Optimal Value

Pick bounds $l \le p^\star \le u$ and tolerance $\epsilon > 0$:

1. Set $t = (l+u)/2$.
2. Solve the feasibility problem: find $x$ s.t. $\phi_t(x) \le 0$, $f_i(x) \le 0$, $Ax=b$.
3. If feasible, $u \gets t$; else, $l \gets t$.
4. Repeat until $u - l < \epsilon$.

The method converts a quasiconvex minimization into a sequence of convex feasibility checks.

## Takeaways

- Convexity of objective and constraints ensures the feasible set is convex and local minima are global.
- First-order conditions simplify to projected gradient orthogonality plus complementary slackness for inequality constraints.
- Problem equivalence (change of variables, slack variables, epigraphs) is a practical toolkit for simplifying formulations.
- Quasiconvex problems retain tractability via bisection on sublevel-set feasibility.
