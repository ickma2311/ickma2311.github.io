## Mathematical Definition

**Constraint Optimization Problems**

Minimize $f_0(x)$, subject to $f_i(x) \leq b_i$, $i=1,2,...,m$

- $x=(x_1,...,x_n)$: optimization variable
- $f_0: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$: objective function
- $f_i: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, $i=1,2,...,m$: constraint functions

**Solution or optimal point** $x^*$ has the smallest value of $f_0$ among all vectors that satisfy the constraints.

## Examples

### Profit Optimization
- **Variables**: amount invested in different assets
- **Constraints**: budget, max/min per asset, minimum return
- **Objective**: overall risk or return variance

### Device Sizing in Electronic Circuits
- **Variables**: device width and lengths
- **Constraints**: manufacturing limits, timing requirements, maximum area
- **Objective**: power consumption

### Data Fitting
- **Variables**: model parameters
- **Constraints**: prior information, parameter limits
- **Objective**: measure of misfit or prediction error, plus regularization term

## Solving Optimization Problems

### General Optimization Problems
- Difficult to solve
- Some compromise: very long computation time, or not always finding the solution

### Exceptions
- Least square problems
- Linear programming
- Convex optimization

## Least Squares

Minimize $\|Ax-b\|_2^2$

- **Analytical solution**: $x^* = (A^\top A)^{-1}A^\top b$
- **Computation time**: proportional to $n^2k$ (where $A \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times n}$)

## Linear Programming

Minimize $c^\top x$

Subject to $a_i^\top x \leq b_i$, $i=1,2,...,m$

- No analytical solution
- Reliable and efficient algorithms, software available
- **Computation time**: proportional to $n^2m$ (if $m \geq n$)

## Convex Optimization

Minimize $f_0(x)$

Subject to $f_i(x) \leq b_i$

**Convexity requirement**: objective and constraint functions are convex:

$$f(\alpha x + \beta y) \leq \alpha f(x) + \beta f(y)$$

where $\alpha > 0$, $\beta > 0$, $\alpha + \beta = 1$

- Least squares and linear programming are special cases
- No analytical solution
- **Computation time**: proportional to $\max(n^3, n^2m, F)$, where $F$ is the cost of evaluating $f_i$'s and their first and second derivatives

## Example: Lamp Illumination Optimization

**Problem**: There are $m$ lamps illuminating $n$ patches. The goal is to choose lamp powers so that all patches have illumination $I_k$ close to a desired value $I_{\text{des}}$, by minimizing the maximum log-illumination error, subject to power constraints.

*Figure: Lamp illumination optimization problem. Given m lamps and n patches, find lamp powers that achieve uniform illumination across all patches while respecting power constraints. This is a convex optimization problem that can be solved efficiently.*

## Key Insight

**Convex optimization bridges the gap between tractable special cases and general nonlinear programming.** Least squares problems have closed-form solutions but are limited in expressiveness. General optimization is flexible but computationally intractable. Convex optimization occupies a sweet spot: it generalizes least squares and linear programming while maintaining polynomial-time solvability through interior-point methods. This makes convex optimization the foundation for practical applications in machine learning, control systems, signal processing, and engineering design.
