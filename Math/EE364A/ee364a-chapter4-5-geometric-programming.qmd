# Geometric Programming

Geometric programming (GP) is a class of problems built from **monomials** and **posynomials** over positive variables. With a logarithmic change of variables, a GP becomes a convex optimization problem, so it can be solved efficiently and globally.

## Monomial functions

A monomial has the form
$$
f(x)=c x_1^{a_1}x_2^{a_2}\dots x_n^{a_n},\quad \mathrm{dom}\,f=\mathbb{R}_{++}^n.
$$

- $c>0$.
  - In algebraic monomials, $c$ can be any real number.
  - In GP, $c$ must be positive so we can write $c=e^{\log c}$.
- $a_i\in\mathbb{R}$.

## Posynomials

A **posynomial** is a sum of monomials:
$$
f(x)=\sum_{k=1}^K c_k x_1^{a_{1k}}x_2^{a_{2k}}\dots x_n^{a_{nk}},\quad \mathrm{dom}\,f=\mathbb{R}_{++}^n.
$$

## Standard GP form

A geometric program is
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{minimize} &\quad f_0(x) \\
\text{subject to} &\quad f_i(x)\le 1,\quad i=1,\dots,m \\
&\quad h_i(x)=1,\quad i=1,\dots,p,
\end{aligned}
$$
where
- $f_0,f_i$ are posynomials,
- $h_i$ are monomials,
- the domain is $\mathbb{R}_{++}^n$.

## GP in convex form

GP is not a standard convex program in $x$, but it becomes convex after a log change of variables.

For a monomial
$$
f(x)=c x_1^{a_1}\dots x_n^{a_n},
$$
define
- $y_i=\log x_i$ so $x_i=e^{y_i}$,
- $b=\log c$ so $c=e^b$.
Then
$$
f(x)=e^{a^\top y+b}.
$$

For a posynomial
$$
f(x)=\sum_{k=1}^K c_k x_1^{a_{1k}}\dots x_n^{a_{nk}},
$$
we get
$$
f(x)=\sum_{k=1}^K e^{a_k^\top y+b_k}.
$$

So the GP becomes
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{minimize} &\quad \sum_{k=1}^{K_0} e^{a_{0k}^\top y+b_{0k}} \\
\text{subject to} &\quad \sum_{k=1}^{K_i} e^{a_{ik}^\top y+b_{ik}} \le 1,\quad i=1,\dots,m \\
&\quad e^{g_i^\top y+h_i}=1,\quad i=1,\dots,p.
\end{aligned}
$$
The monomial equality constraint is equivalent to the affine constraint
$$
g_i^\top y+h_i=0.
$$

It is also common to take logs of the posynomial constraints and objective (monotone transformation):
$$
\tilde f_i(y)=\log\Big(\sum_{k=1}^{K_i} e^{a_{ik}^\top y+b_{ik}}\Big),\quad i=0,\dots,m.
$$
Then the convex form is
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{minimize} &\quad \tilde f_0(y) \\
\text{subject to} &\quad \tilde f_i(y)\le 0,\quad i=1,\dots,m \\
&\quad g_i^\top y+h_i=0,\quad i=1,\dots,p.
\end{aligned}
$$
Here $\tilde f_i$ are log-sum-exp functions (convex), and the equality constraints are affine, so the problem is convex.

# Examples

## Cantilever beam design

We design a **cantilever beam** with a vertical load $F$ applied at the free end. The beam is split into $N$ equal-length segments. Segment $i$ has a rectangular cross section with width $w_i$ and height $h_i$.

The goal is to **minimize total volume** while respecting geometry and mechanics:
$$
\min \sum_{i=1}^N w_i h_i.
$$

Subject to:
- **Geometric bounds**:
  $$
  w_{\min} \le w_i \le w_{\max},\quad h_{\min} \le h_i \le h_{\max}.
  $$
- **Aspect ratio constraints**:
  $$
  S_{\min} \le \frac{h_i}{w_i} \le S_{\max}.
  $$
- **Stress constraints**:
  $$
  \sigma_i = \frac{6 i F}{w_i h_i^2} \le \sigma_{\max}.
  $$
- **Deflection constraint**:
  $$
  y_1 \le y_{\max}.
  $$

The deflections $y_i$ and slopes $v_i$ follow beam-recursion relations with boundary conditions $v_{N+1}=y_{N+1}=0$.

**Why this is a GP**
- Each term $w_i h_i$ is a monomial, so the volume is a posynomial.
- Geometric bounds and aspect ratio constraints can be written as monomial inequalities.
- Stress constraints take the monomial form $c\,w_i^{-1}h_i^{-2}\le\sigma_{\max}$.
- The recursive formulas for $v_i$ and $y_i$ are built from sums and products of monomials/posynomials, so $v_i$ and $y_i$ are posynomials by induction.
- Therefore the deflection constraint $y_1\le y_{\max}$ is a posynomial inequality.

Since all constraints and the objective are posynomials/monomials over positive variables, the problem is a valid GP and can be solved globally after the log transform.
